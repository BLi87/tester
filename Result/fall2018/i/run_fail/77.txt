-- Find names of all drinkers who frequent

-- 1. Join frequents and serves, where the bar is the same

-- 3. Diff these drinker/beer pairs with likes.

-- 4. Since you know that these drinkers do not like these beers,
-- and these beers were served at bars the drinkers went to,
-- diff all drinkers minus these drinkers.
