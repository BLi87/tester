-- For each bar, find the drinker who frequents it the greatest number of times. Your output should be
-- a list of (bar, drinker) pairs. If multiple drinkers tie for the most frequent visitor to a bar, list them all
-- as separate pairs.

(select distinct bar, drinker from frequents)
except
(select freq1.bar, freq1.drinker
from frequents as freq1
join frequents
on freq1.bar=frequents.bar and freq1.times_a_week<frequents.times_a_week);
