/* amount = price of drink * how many times/week it was bought
find the table of drinkers who go to bars that serve some beers they like, and the price of that beer
and how many times the drinker goes to said bar.
and then group by bar to see how much was spent at that bar. 
Then order by decreasing amount
then check for null case at the beginning ... but how? */
