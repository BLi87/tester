-- Suppose that each time a drinker visits a bar, he or she  always buys one glass of each beer served at this bar that he or she likes.
-- If no such beer exists, he or she will not buy anything. Calculate, for each bar, the total amount of money it expects to get per week (over all drinkers).
-- List (bar, amount) pairs in decreasing order of amount.
-- In cases of ties, sort alphabetically by bar.
-- Be sure to handle teh case when a bar doesn't expect to sell any beer to our drinkers -- you need to show an amount of 0.
