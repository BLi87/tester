GROUP BY total.t1 ORDER BY sum DESC;

--Thus far, this code creates a table of frequents, likes, serves by merging like values (for beers and bars),
-- multiplies the price per beer by the number of times a week the bar is frequented for a person,
--then adds those values and groups  it by bar (in decscending order)
--thus, it returns a table of beers bars and the amount of money they make per week

--However, this code does not consider when a bar makes $0 a week
--this could be fixed by adding a conditional in the initial joining of the table of Frequents, Likes, and Serves
--This would solve the issue if a bar is not listed in "frequents" at all
