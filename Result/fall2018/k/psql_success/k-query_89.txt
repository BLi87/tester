/*
Suppose that each time a drinker visits a bar (according to the frequency in Frequents),
her or she always buys one glass of each beer served at this bar that he or she likes;
if no such beer exists, he or she will not buy anything. Calculate, for each bar, the total
amount of money it expects to get per week (over all drinkers).
List the (bar, amount) pairs in decreasing order of amount.
In case of ties, sort alphabetically by bar.
Be sure to handle the case when a bar doesn't expect to sell any beer to our drinkers â€“
you should show an amount of 0.
